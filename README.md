<h1>Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes</h1>


This repository contains all the exercises and projects from the book. I chose to work through it to learn Python and Django,
and decided to turn it into a repository that could also serve as part of my portfolio.
